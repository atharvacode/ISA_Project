            Temperature is a physical quantity. At a fundamental level,
            temperature is related to the kinetic energy of atoms and
            molecules. India is one of the most climatically diverse countries
            in the world; so the temperature varies largely based on the
            geographical location and time of the year. From desert in the
            north-west to the sea in the south uptill the himalayas, the range
            is fluctuous. India's lowest recorded temperature was −60.0 °C in
            Dras, Ladakh; and the highest temperature ever recorded in India
            occurred on 19 May 2016 in Phalodi, Jodhpur District, Rajasthan at
            51.0 °C

            The Climate of Mumbai is a tropical, wet and dry climate. Mumbai's
            climate can be best described as moderately hot with high level of
            humidity. Its coastal nature and tropical location ensure
            temperatures do not fluctuate much throughout the year. The
            highest temperature ever recorded in Mumbai's history is 42.2 °C ,
            on 14 April 1952. While the lowest is 7.4 °C, on 22 January 1962,
            both of which were recorded at the airport. The mean average
            temperature is 27.2 °C. The mean maximum average temperatures is
            about 32 °C in summer and 30 °C in winter, while the average
            minimums are 25 °C in summer and 18 °C in winter.

        Humidity is the concentration of water vapour present in the air.
        Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the
        human eye. Humidity depends on the temperature and pressure of the
        surroundings. Relative humidity is most widely used measurement unit.
        The relative humidity unit measures how much water the air can hold
        over a fairly wide temperature range, and it measures how much
        moisture is currently in the air. It’s represented by a percentage.
        100-percent represents the air being at its full capacity of moisture,
        and 0-percent represents air that doesn’t have any moisture in it.
        Humidity plays an important role for surface life. For animal life
        dependent on perspiration (sweating) to regulate internal body
        temperature, high humidity impairs heat exchange efficiency by
        reducing the rate of moisture evaporation from skin surfaces.

          Maharashtra has a tropical climate, with three distinct seasons: 
          summer (March–May), monsoon (June–September), and winter (October–February). 
          However, dew and hail also occur sometimes, depending on seasonal weather. 
          The winter between October to February is followed by summer between March and May
          and the monsoon season between June and September. Ratnagiri district receives the
          highest average rainfall whereas Ahmednagar receives the lowest. Mean rainfall during 
          monsoon has been 1,020.7mm and 1,146.5mm annually for the state, which means over 89%
          of annual rain is received during monsoon.

      <p>
        The rain in India is predominantly attributed to the monsoon.
        Usually, the term monsoon is used to refer to the rainy phase of a seasonally changing pattern,
        although technically there is also a dry phase. The term is also
        sometimes used to describe locally heavy but short-term rains.
        The monsoon of South Asia is among several geographically distributed global monsoons.
        It affects the Indian subcontinent, where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated
        weather phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September.
        Mawsynram receives the highest rainfall in India. It is reportedly the wettest place on Earth,
        with an average annual rainfall of 11,872 millimetres. Jaisalmer district located in the state
        of Rajasthan has the lowest annual rainfall in India. It has a rainfall measuring upto just a
        small number of 8.3 cms. Ruyli that is located in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan is particularly
        known to receive the lowest amount of rainfall.
